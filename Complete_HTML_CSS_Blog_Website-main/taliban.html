                            <h3>Taliban - UPSC International Relations Notes</h3>
            
                            The Taliban have ruled Afghanistan since August 16, 2021. The rapid collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban's takeover of the presidential palace appear to have caused panic and fear among the Afghan people, many of whom are boarding planes to leave the country.President Ashraf Ghani said he fled to Tajikistan on 15 August, but this has not been confirmed.

                            The Taliban (also known as the Taliban) is an Islamic fundamentalist political and military organization operating in Afghanistan. They have dominated Afghan politics for some time and regularly appear on international affairs.
                            They are therefore an important organization for the International Relations segment of IAS Audit.
                            
                            In this article you can read all about what the Taliban are, how they came into being and the role they played and still play in the world, especially in Afghanistan. You can also read about relations with India.<br>
            
            <h3> Who are the Taliban?</h3><br>
            
            The Taliban is a Sunni fundamentalist organization that interferes in Afghan politics. It is also a military group involved in an insurgency against the currently elected government in Afghanistan.

            The Taliban ruled almost three quarters of the country from 1996 until he was in 2001 and was noted for its strict enforcement of Sharia (Islamic law) there.
            Human rights violations, especially against women, were widespread during this period.
            The current leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akunzada.
            Mullah Omar is considered the founder of the Taliban. He died in his 2013.
            The Taliban officially call themselves the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan".
            The word "Taliban" means "student" in Pashto.<br>
            <h3>Afghanistan under the Taliban regime</h3><br>
            
            When they came to power, the people of Afghanistan generally welcomed the Taliban at first, as they appeared to bring stability to a country ravaged by a long and bloody civil war.

The Taliban's promise was to restore peace and prosperity to Afghanistan and enforce Sharia law in the country. His 4,444 Afghans, tired of fighting between the Soviets and the Mujahideen, welcomed the Taliban.
The Taliban introduced an interpretation of Islamic law. This meant that some rights for people, especially women and children, were suspended.
They advocated Sharia mixed with the Pashtun code. 4,444 women were forced to wear a burqa that covered their entire body, including their face. Men had to wear beards.
women were unable to leave their homes without a male family escort. They couldn't work outside.
The Taliban discouraged girls from attending school and banned girls over the age of eight from attending school.
Public executions were carried out on those accused of murder and adultery. Amputations were also carried out on those accused of theft.
They banned television, music, kite flying, movies, photography, painting, etc. Women were prohibited from attending or participating in sporting events. 4,444 people, especially women, were publicly flogged for alleged wrongdoing.
The Taliban have also been accused of massacres of civilians, especially ethnic or religious minorities. Thousands of people were killed, women were raped, and people are still missing.
Needless to say, they didn't believe in democracy.
The Taliban were widely criticized for blowing up his 1,500-year-old Buddha statue in Bamiyan as an idol.<br>
            
           <h3> Taliban – International Relations</h3><br>
            
           When the Taliban were in power, only three countries recognized the Taliban: Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. They are said to have received funding from both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
           After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the Taliban came to the attention of the world.
           Accused of harboring Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, blamed for the September 11 attacks.
           In fact, the United States intervened in her 2001 in Afghanistan, denying al Qaeda a safe haven and base of operations in the country.
           Pakistan officially cut diplomatic ties with the organization after 9/11. However, many of the top Taliban leaders are said to have fled to Quetta, Pakistan, where they controlled the organization.
           The Taliban were ousted from power in October 2001 by coalition forces led by the United States and several other countries, including NATO countries.
           In December 2001, a new interim government headed by Hamid Karzai was installed in Afghanistan.
           After years of struggle and underdevelopment, the country began to slowly rebuild.
           After being defeated, however, the Taliban were regrouped by leader Mullah Omar, who led an uprising against the Afghan government.
           In the late 2000s, the number of civilian killings slowly increased.
           The Taliban held talks with the United States eager to leave the country. See his CNA on March 2, 2020 for more details.
           In the process of the planned US withdrawal, the newly formed administration of President Joe Biden has presented a draft peace deal with Afghanistan in March 2021. A draft peace agreement proposed by the United States aims to give peace talks in Afghanistan a "jump start" and provides for the formation of an interim government with the Taliban and provisions to prevent terrorist activity inside Afghanistan. contains the<br>
            
           <h3> India’s Relations with the Taliban</h3><br>
            
           India never acknowledged the Taliban while they were in power. In 1999, an Air India plane was hijacked and landed in Kandahar, with the Taliban suspected of aiding the hijackers. India also supported the Northern Alliance, a major anti-Taliban group. Following US-Taliban peace talks in 2019, the Taliban have sought a positive relationship with India. To this end, the Taliban reiterated that Kashmir is India's internal affair and does not seek to interfere in other countries' affairs.<br>
