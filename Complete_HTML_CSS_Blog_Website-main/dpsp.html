                            <h3>Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)</h3>
            
                            The concept of the Policy Principles of National Policy (DPSP) originated in the Spanish Constitution, from which it was incorporated into the Irish Constitution.
                            The concept of DPSP is derived from Article 45 of the Irish Constitution.<br>
            
            <h3>Constitutional Provisions:</h3><br>
            
             Part 4 of the Indian Constitution (Articles 36 to 51) contains the Principles of National Policy (DPSP) Directives.
Article 37 of the Indian Constitution provides for the application of policy principles.
These principles aim to ensure socio-economic justice for the people and establish India as a welfare state.<br>
            <h3>Fundamental Rights vs. DPSP:</h3><br>
            
            
Unlike the Fundamental Rights (FR), the DPSP has unlimited scope, protects the rights of citizens and works at a macro level. The
DPSP comprises all the ideals that a nation should pursue and keep in mind when formulating national policies and enacting laws.
The principles of the Guidelines are positive directives, but the fundamental rights are of a negative or prohibited nature as they impose restrictions on the State.
DPSP is not legally enforceable. It cannot be justified. It is important to note that
DPSP and FR are closely related.
DPSP is not dependent on FR.<br>

           <h3>What is the conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSPs?</h3>
           Four court cases, listed below, help candidates understand the relationship between fundamental rights and the policy principles of national policy.<br>

<strong>Champakam Dorairajan case (1951):</strong>The former prevails. DPSP was considered a subsidiary of the Fundamental Rights. The SC also ruled that Congress could amend the fundamental rights through the Constitutional Amendment Act to implement the DPSP.<br>

Result: Congress passed the First Amendment (1951), Fourth Amendment (1955), and Seventeenth Amendment (1964) to implement several directives.<br>

<strong>Golaknath (1967)</strong><br>

The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot amend the fundamental right to implement principles of national policy.
Result: Congress enacted the 24th Amendment Act of 1971 and the 25th Amendment Act of 1971, declaring it has the power to limit or revoke fundamental rights by passing Constitutional Amendment Acts. The 25th Amendment inserted a new Section 31c, which contains the following two provisions:<br>

Section 14 (Equal before law and Equal protection under law), Section 19 (Protection of six rights such as freedom of speech, assembly and movement) or Section 31 (Right to property) Void Fundamental Rights .<br>
 A law containing a declaration implementing such policy cannot be challenged in court on the grounds that it does not affect such policy.<br>
<strong>Kesavananda Bharti (1973)</strong>

Supreme Court excluded his second provision of Section 31C, which was added by the 25th Amendment in his Golaknath case of 1967. He called the provision "unconstitutional."
However, it held that the first provision of Section 31c was constitutional and valid.<br>

Result: With the 42nd Amendment Act, Congress expanded the scope of the first provision of Section 31c. It gave legal supremacy and priority to the principles of the Fundamental Rights Directive conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31, which are unconstitutional and invalid. Subordinated the DPSP to the Fundamental Rights.
The Supreme Court also ruled that the Indian Constitution rests on the foundation of a balance between fundamental rights and policy principles. revolution.
Harmony and balance between fundamental rights and national policy guidelines are essential features of the constitutional fabric.
The objectives set out in the policy principles must be achieved without overriding the means provided by the fundamental rights.<br>
Conclusion: Fundamental rights now take precedence over the principles of the Guidelines.
However, policy principles can be implemented. Congress may amend the fundamental rights to implement the principles of the Directive so long as the amendments do not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.
